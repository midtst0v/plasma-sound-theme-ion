# Ion - A KDE Plasma Sound Theme
A custom KDE Plasma sound scheme. All sounds created using Surge XT and Ableton Live 12.  
**Disclaimer: This theme does not include sounds for all events specified by the [XDG standard](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/sound-theme-spec/). However, it does its best to cover the most frequently encountered desktop events.**  
  
If you'd like to suggest additional event sounds, feel free to create an issue with the *enhancement* label.
## Why?
I found KDE's default [Ocean](https://github.com/KDE/ocean-sound-theme) sound theme to be quite grating and drawn-out. I understand the author's philosophy behind it, but it's not my cup of tea.  
Following modern design philosophies, these sounds intend on being snappy, expressive, and unintrusive. They mostly use low/mid-range tones and deliver audible feedback to the user without wasting their time.
