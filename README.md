# Ion - A KDE Plasma Sound Theme
A custom (incomplete) sound scheme. All sounds created using Surge XT and Ableton Live 12. 
## Why?
I found the available default sound schemes to be quite harsh, jarring, and drawn-out. 
Following a more modern design philosophy, these sounds intend on being snappy, expressive, and unintrusive. They deliver audible feedback to the user without wasting their time.
